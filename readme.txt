= <strong>How does it work?</strong> =

Content that your user has entered onto your website is sent to our API; this is to validate whether the content includes offensive language. censorREACT then replaces the offensive language with an asterisk (*) for each letter of the word. 

Eg. If the word ‘random’ was a bad word. The content below: 

This is a really random sentence. Why would you write a random sentence? Who thinks of this random stuff? 

Would look like this: 

This is a really ****** sentence. Why would you write a ****** sentence? Who thinks of this ****** stuff?
